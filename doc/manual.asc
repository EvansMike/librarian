= Manual for Librarian

Last update: 2022-06-06

Including User Manual and Technical Notes



== Introduction

The Librarian in a python application for storing the contents of your book library using a web-cam to scan the ISBN code.  It also tracks loaned out books.  (Which was the original purpose as I often loan books and never see them again).  Provided an internet connection is available the ISBN is looked up in a database and the book details returned.  Books can be also added manually.  Back end storage uses a MySQL or sqlite3 database.  It is not a polished product but serves my needs well.



== Setup

Unzip all the files into a suitable directory.  Make sure the python files are executable using chmod +x *.py.  Create the database using the command "mysql dbname [-p] < database.schema.sql".  On first run a dummy config file is created, this will have to edited to reference your newly created database.  On second run the program should connect to the database successfully.  If not check your connection details.  Some additional Python libraries will be required to run the application, these are listed in the README.



== Usage

Start librarian in the usual way.  A list of stored books is displayed with sortable columns and a tool menu.   Initially of course your book list be empty and you will need to add some books.



=== Adding a Book by Scanning with a Camera

You will need to have a web-cam plugged in and set to focus quite close, 6” to 8” perhaps.
Click the “Scan New” to open a dialogue window.
Press the scan button and a camera window will appear, this can be used to focus and position the camera.
As soon as the bar-code is acquired the camera window will close and the book details should appear in the Window.
Clicking the “EDIT” button will open the edit dialog, from here you can update the details and add the book.
Closing the window will reveal the book added to the book list.
It is of course possible to own more than one copy of a book.
Scanning a book twice will add a warning that you already own the book and you have to option to add the book or not.



==== Adding a Book by Scanning with a Scanner

Plug in a USB barcode scanner.
Press SCAN NEW as above.
The scan button should be disable and simply using the scanner as normal will cause a book lookup.
Proceed as before.



=== Adding a Book Manually

Books can be added manually by filling in the fields in the query window and clicking the  NEW BOOK button.  If a current book's details are already displayed, use the CLEAR button to clear all the fields prior to entering a new book's details.



=== Editing a Book's Details

when in list view you can edit a bok by double clicking or selecting QUERY from the LH menu, having previously seleted the book in the list. This will open a new window where edits can be made. The UPDATE button saves the new details to the database. Closing this window without UPDATE will pop up a prompt to save the changes.



=== Lending a Book

To lend a book you need to add a borrower.  This is done in the query window.  Double click the book the book you wish to lend, or select and click QUERY to open the query window.  If the borrower is not in the drop down list of borrowers, click the ADD button to open the add borrower window.  Fill in the details and click OK.
Once a borrower has been inserted you can lend a book.  Select the book and click on “QUERY” to open a query window.  Select the borrowers name from the drop-down list and click the borrowed button.  Close the window.  Now clicking the “BORROWED” button in the main window will display a list of borrowed books.  In addition, books you have been lent are also listed along with the name of the person you borrowed it from.



=== Returned Books

Once a borrower returns a book, select the book in the main window and click ”QUERY”.  The borrowed will be shown checked and name of the borrower will be in the drop-down list window.  Simply press the borrowed button to un-check it and close the window.  The book will no longer be in the borrowed list. 
If you return a book to a lender simply remove the book from your database using the query window and the REMOVE button



== Printing the Book List

If you require a printout of your book listing, "PRINT LIST" will output a PDF file of the entire listing.



== Technical Notes

Will be here one day.  Maybe.
